# LOCK.GITECH

This project is done by **Wei Wen**, **Aviel**, **Jian Sheng**, **Rifah**.

## Description

The project called `lock.gitech` is a security system designed to provide access control using multiple authentication methods including RFID, fingerprint, and keypad. Additionally, it incorporates AWS data logging for enhanced security and monitoring capabilities.

### How it Works

The `lock.gitech` system integrates various components to manage access control efficiently:

- **RFID**: Users can authenticate themselves by presenting an RFID tag or card.
- **Fingerprint**: Biometric fingerprint authentication adds an extra layer of security.
- **Keypad**: A keypad allows users to input a PIN for authentication.
- **AWS Data Logging**: Data logging to AWS ensures secure storage of access logs and provides remote access for monitoring and management purposes.
